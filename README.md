## Introduction

Retention-AI is a machine learning project focused on early churn detection and providing data-driven strategies for customer retention. This repository contains the code, models, and documentation necessary to understand, reproduce, and deploy our churn prediction system.

### Try It Out!

## Data Processing
# Data Processing  

## Dataset Used: Telco Customer Churn  
The **Telco Customer Churn** dataset was selected as it contains customer demographics, account details, and service usage information, making it suitable for predicting churn.  

## Data Cleaning & Preprocessing  

### 1. Handling Missing Values  
- Identified missing or incorrect values in the **TotalCharges** column.  
- Converted it to numeric format (`float64`), replacing non-numeric values with `NaN`.  
- Imputed missing values with `0`.  

### 2. Encoding Categorical Variables  
- **Binary Encoding:** Converted categorical variables with two unique values (e.g., `gender`, `Partner`, `Churn`) into binary (`0` and `1`).  
- **One-Hot Encoding:** Applied one-hot encoding for categorical columns with more than two values (`Contract`, `InternetService`, `PaymentMethod`), dropping the first category to avoid multicollinearity.  

### 3. Handling "No phone service"/"No internet service" Entries  
- Replaced `"No phone service"` and `"No internet service"` with `"No"` in relevant columns (`MultipleLines`, `OnlineSecurity`, `OnlineBackup`, etc.).  
- Mapped `"No"` to `0` and `"Yes"` to `1`.  

### 4. Feature Type Adjustments  
- Ensured one-hot encoded columns were correctly cast to integers (`int`).  

### 5. Dropping Unnecessary Columns  
- Removed `customerID`, as it is an identifier with no predictive value.  

### 6. Saving Processed Data  
- The cleaned dataset was saved as `telco_cleaned.csv` in the processed data folder for model training.  

### Absence of Temporal Data  
This dataset lacks a **time-series** component, meaning it does not track customer behavior over time. This limits the modelâ€™s ability to detect gradual disengagement trends, which would typically be useful for predicting churn **before** obvious signs appear.
